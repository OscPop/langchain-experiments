# Experiments with langchain
Langchain is an emerging python library that utilizes LLMs in clever ways. This allows people to create powerful applications with very high level code and abstraction.

## Requirements
There is a `requirements.txt` file that shows exactly which libraries and versions I have installed in my virtual environment. 

### Virtual environment
Creating a virtual environment can be done by typing `python -m venv {YOUR_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}`. To activate the virtual environment you need to type `YOUR_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME/Scripts/Activate` if on Windows or `YOUR_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME/bin/activate`.

When you have activated your virtual environment you will need to install the necessary libraries. The easiest way to do this is to type `python -m pip install requirements.txt`.
